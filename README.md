# Portfolio-svelte-static

My first Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## About this project

I built this project entirely on [`replit.com`](https://replit.com)! <br>
A large majority is done using the mobile app on my Galaxy Z Flip 3 <br>
No.. the screen size isnt exactly ideal for editing code but hey it works for me.<br>
<br>
I've spent some time messing with raw html, css and js and figured id see what all the framework hype was all about.<br>
So far im enjoying using svelte as it feels pretty natural compared to how react/react-native felt like i had to relearn everything from the beginning.
